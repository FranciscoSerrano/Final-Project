# Face and Mask Detection Models

> This sub project folder holds our data, data wrangling, and machine learning models.

## Project

### üìä Wrangling the Data

Image files of faces with and without face mask.

data folder has four sub folders that house the image data we are using to train the model & using to test the model's prdictions.

 - procssed has all the model images in two categories.
 - external has completely seprate images to test the finished model aganist.

### üòÄ Face Detection Model

OpenCV provides the CascadeClassifier class that can be used to create a cascade classifier for face detection. The constructor can take a filename as an argument that specifies the XML file for a pre-trained model.

OpenCV provides a number of pre-trained models as part of the installation. These are available on your system and are also available on the OpenCV GitHub project.

Download a pre-trained model for frontal face detection from the OpenCV GitHub project and place it in your current working directory with the filename ‚Äòhaarcascade_frontalface_default.xml‚Äò.

### üò∑ Mask Detection Model

Use a cascade classifer to detect a face in a webcam window, extract the face and pass it to a convolutional neural network to classify the image as "mask" or "no mask".

          <p>
            Inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, this project will aim to create a model 
            that can tell whether or not a person has a face mask on. Additionally, we 
            will create a dashboard that will provide general COVID-19 information as well 
            as information regarding the positive outcomes of using masks.
